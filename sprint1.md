#Sprint 1

##Due date: November 24th 2016

##Tasks
1. Database setup (Ke)
    - GET/POST users (check design.md for required user information) to a database
    - GET/POST listings (check design.md for required listing information) to a database
    - Simple front-end page to display a specific user or listing
        - Very minimal styling
    
2. User authorization (David)
    - Implement Login/Signup
        - Must differentiate between a user and an admin using sessions, cookies etc.
    - Simple front-end page to allow a user to enter login/signup information
        - Very minimal styling
        
##Additional Notes
In case we do not have time or it is too difficult to implement a chat service,
we will instead allow users to post comments on other users' profiles to fulfill 
the 'social' requirement for the project
The chat service and admin tickets will be lowest priority for now.
