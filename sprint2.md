#Sprint 2

##Due date: November 26th 2016

##Tasks
1. Database (Ke)
    - Translate current database to Meteor

2. User authorization (Anne)
    - Implement Login/Signup
    - Must differentiate between a user and an admin using sessions, cookies etc.
    - Create homepage (for a non-user)
        
3. Set up live server using Heroku (David)

4. Create listing (Jeremy)
    - Create form for a listing
    - Connect form to database (POST the data)

##Additional Notes
In case we do not have time or it is too difficult to implement a chat service,
we will instead allow users to post comments on other users' profiles to fulfill 
the 'social' requirement for the project.
The chat service and admin tickets will be lowest priority.
