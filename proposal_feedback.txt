Feedback: if you need to deprioritize any features it would be the following:

-Any user will have the option to block another user which prevents both usersâ€™ postings
and profile from being visible to each other and disables communication between the
two.
- Any user will have option to report another user which may result in reported user being
deleted, banned etc.
- Once a report has been resolved by an admin, a message (via inbox/chat or email) will be sent to the users involved in the report.
-Extra Features

I would suggest allowing users to browse profiles in addition to searching
